<strong>Summary</strong>

<p>This project is creating a novel paradigm for computer vision, termed "reconstructive recognition", that incorporates the strongest elements of previous machine learning-based recognition efforts and the strongest elements of previous reconstruction efforts based on radiometric reasoning.</p>

<p>
The process of simultaneous reconstruction and recognition is well illustrated by Adelson's Checkershadow, where humans can tell shadow from paint
and successfully perceive a regular checkerboard, despite the shadow's being strong enough to
make squares A and B have exactly the same shade of gray. This suggests a synergy between
reconstruction and recognition. Reconstruction helps recognition since shadows can be detected
locally based on their distinguished "soft edge" structure, and then discounted. At the same
time, recognition helps reconstruction since the presence of a recognizable cylinder suggests the
presence of its shadow, which can then be discounted. It makes sense for these processes to occur
simultaneously, sharing intermediate representations between them and allowing each to benefit
from the strengths of the other. This type of interconnected processing will be critical for robotic vision systems to succeed in the real world where related phenomena are ubiquitous.
</p>

<p>
 The goal of the project is to provide a new foundation for machine perception, and the potential for a transformative advance in applications of computer vision. It seeks novel physics-based methods for recognition as well as novel learning-based methods for interpreting pixel values in terms of the physics of a scene. The agenda is structured around four aims: Aim I develops generalized reconstructive processes that unify the recovery of shape, materials, motion and illumination. Aim II focuses on supervised visual learning methods that exploit such reconstructive image representations. Aim III pursues unsupervised discovery of reconstructive representations that converge to be similar to the engineered models of Aim I. Finally, Aim IV introduces well-defined challenge problems that focus the field and serve as measurable proxies for progress in computer vision applications that have high potential impact on society. 
</p>

<p>There is a significant broader impact to this project, not least being the improvement in computer vision pedagogy that ensues from a reunification of the currently divergent recognition and reconstruction views of the field. More broadly, this project pursues critical steps toward a future where machines can see, a future that will bring changes to robotics, human-computer interfaces, security, and autonomous navigation, to name a few.</p>
